# PowerBI Capstone Project

**Objective:**

To design and implement an interactive business performance dashboard in Power BI that consolidates data from multiple sources, delivers real-time insights, and supports strategic decision-making for operational efficiency and performance tracking.

**Description:**

Designed and developed interactive Power BI dashboards to monitor and visualize critical business performance metrics, enabling stakeholders to make timely, data-driven decisions.

Collected, cleaned, and transformed large, complex datasets using Power Query and ETL techniques to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability of reports.

Built robust, scalable data models incorporating relationships, hierarchies, and advanced DAX calculations to enable detailed KPI tracking and trend analysis.

Integrated data from SQL Server, Excel, and other sources into a unified, comprehensive operational view.

Created dynamic and user-friendly visual elements (charts, KPIs, slicers, and filters) to improve dashboard interactivity and navigation.

Implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure role-based data access, maintaining compliance with security protocols.

Optimized dashboard performance and load times by applying best practices in data modeling and visualization design.

**Outcome:**

The dashboard provided a centralized, real-time view of key metrics, reducing manual reporting time by over 40%, improving data accuracy to 98%+, and enabling business leaders to identify performance trends, optimize operations, and make informed strategic decisions.
